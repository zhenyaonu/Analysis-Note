    abstract = {A set $E\subseteq {\Bbb C}^{n}$ is h-straight if E has finite Hausdorff h-measure equal to its Hausdorff h-content, where h: [0,∞)→ [0,∞) is continuous and non-decreasing with h(0)=0. Here, if h satisfies the standard doubling condition, then every set of finite Hausdorff h-measure in Rn is shown to be a countable union of h-straight sets. This also settles a conjecture of Foran that when h(t)=ts, every set of finite s-measure is a countable union of s-straight sets.},
